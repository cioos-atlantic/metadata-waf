  abstract:
    en: 'The Centre for Marine Applied Research (CMAR) measures environmental data
      throughout Nova Scotia’s coastal waters as part of the Coastal Monitoring Program.
      This program was initiated by the Nova Scotia Department of Fisheries and Aquaculture
      in 2012 and CMAR became involved in 2017.  CMAR collects temperature, dissolved
      oxygen, and intermittent salinity data using autonomous sensors attached to
      moored lines, called ‘sensor strings’. Each string is attached to the seafloor
      by an anchored acoustic release and suspended by a sub-surface buoy, with sensors
      attached at various depths. Sensor strings are typically deployed for several
      months, and data are measured every 1 minute to 1 hour depending on the sensor.
      This process may produce tens- to hundreds- of thousands of observations for
      a single deployment. Data are retrieved by triggering the acoustic release,
      enabling the sensor string to float to the surface for data download.  The Coastal
      Monitoring Program data is organized by county. Each county dataset has the
      following columns: WATERBODY: waterbody in which the string was deployed. STATION:
      area where the string was deployed. LEASE: if the string was deployed on an
      aquaculture lease area, the lease number (NA otherwise). DEPLOYMENT_PERIOD:
      the deployment and retrieval dates. LATITUDE: latitude at which the string was
      deployed (decimal degrees). LONGITUDE: longitude at which the string was deployed
      (decimal degrees). TIMESTAMP: timestamp of the measurement (in UTC). SENSOR:
      model and serial number of the sensor that recorded the measurement. VARIABLE:
      parameter measured (Temperature, Dissolved Oxygen, or Salinity). DEPTH: approximate
      depth of the sensor at low tide (in metres). VALUE: value of the measurement
      (units are degrees Celsius for Temperature, % saturation for Dissolved Oxygen,
      and parts per thousand for Salinity). Note that some data were excluded from
      the dataset due to quality control processes.   These datasets are very large,
      typically exceeding the number of rows that can be viewed in Excel. We recommend
      using the filter options of the Open Data Portal to filter to the WATERBODY,
      STATION, DEPTH, VARIABLE, and/or TIMESTAMP of interest before exporting. A chart
      derived from the dataset also allows for interactive filtering and export (https://data.novascotia.ca/Nature-and-Environment/Coastal-Monitoring-Program-Halifax-County-Daily-Av/vpt7-apvp).  Coastal
      Monitoring Program data for other Nova Scotia counties is also available through
      the Open Data Portal. The "Coastal Monitoring Program: Station Locations" dataset
      on the Portal shows locations with available data (https://data.novascotia.ca/Nature-and-Environment/Coastal-Monitoring-Program-Station-Locations/cjfb-f4d4).
      Summary reports by county are available on the CMAR website (https://cmar.ca/2020/07/14/coastal-monitoring-program/).
      Data collection and retrieval are ongoing. The datasets and reports may be revised
      pending ongoing data collection and analyses. '
