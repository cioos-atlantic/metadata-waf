  abstract:
    en: 'The Centre for Marine Applied Research (CMAR) provides high resolution data
      on ocean variables from around the coast of Nova Scotia through their Coastal
      Monitoring Program. The program was initiated by the Nova Scotia Department
      of Fisheries and Aquaculture (NSDFA) in 2015. In 2019, CMAR assumed responsibility
      for the program and expanded its scope and mandate. Through the Wave Branch
      of the program, CMAR processes and publishes Wave data collected by NSDFA. The
      data are measured by upward facing Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (ADCPs)
      that are mounted on the sea floor for 1 - 3 months. An ADCP uses sound to measure
      wave variables including height, period, and direction. NSDFA uses several ADCP
      instrument models, including the Sentinel V20, Sentinel V50, Sentinel V100,
      and Workhorse Sentinel 600kHz. The data is processed using Velocity and WavesMon4
      Software, and then compiled and formatted for publication with CMAR’s waves
      R package. An automated “Gross Range” test was applied to the data to identify
      statistical outliers. Each data point was assigned a flag value of “Pass”, “Suspect/Of
      Interest”, or “Fail”. Observations flagged as “Pass” passed the test (i.e.,
      were not considered outliers) and can be included in analyses. Observations
      flagged as “Fail” were considered outliers and should be excluded from most
      analyses. Observations flagged as “Suspect/Of Interest” were either poor quality
      or highlight an unusual event, and should be carefully reviewed before being
      included in analyses. Flags should be used as a guide only, and data users are
      responsible for evaluating the quality of the data prior to use in any analysis.  The
      "Nova Scotia Current and Wave Data: Deployment Information" dataset on this
      Portal shows all locations with available Wave data collected through CMAR’s
      Coastal Monitoring Program (https://data.novascotia.ca/Fishing-and-Aquaculture/Nova-Scotia-Current-and-Wave-Data-Deployment-Infor/uban-q9i2/about_data).
      Summary reports for each county are available on the CMAR website (https://cmar.ca/coastal-monitoring-program/).
      Data collection and retrieval are ongoing. The datasets and reports may be revised
      pending ongoing data collection and analyses.  If you have accessed any Coastal
      Monitoring Program data, CMAR would appreciate your anonymous feedback: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe3TD6umrsVVKnQL13VVMJIpckCi2ctONJsgN7_g-4c-tKTuw/viewform.
