  abstract:
    en: 'The Centre for Marine Applied Research (CMAR) measures essential ocean variables
      throughout Nova Scotia’s coastal waters as part of the Coastal Monitoring Program.
      This program was initiated by the Nova Scotia Department of Fisheries and Aquaculture
      in 2012 and CMAR became involved in 2017. CMAR collects water quality data (temperature,
      dissolved oxygen, and intermittent salinity) using autonomous sensors deployed
      on “sensor strings”. A sensor string typically consists of a line anchored to
      the sea floor by an acoustic release and suspended by a sub-surface buoy, with
      sensors attached at various depths below the surface (as measured at low tide).
      Alternatively, a string may be attached to surface moorings, including floating
      docks, buoys, and equipment. Sensor strings are deployed for several months,
      and data are measured every 1 minute to 1 hour. Sensors are retrieved for data
      offload by triggering the acoustic release when applicable, by directly removing
      from surface moorings, or occasionally by divers or dragging.  The Coastal Monitoring
      Program data is organized by county. These datasets are very large, typically
      exceeding the number of rows that can be viewed in Excel. CMAR recommends using
      the filter options of the Open Data Portal to filter to the WATERBODY, STATION,
      DEPTH, VARIABLE, and/or TIMESTAMP of interest before exporting. A chart derived
      from the dataset also allows for interactive filtering and export (https://data.novascotia.ca/Nature-and-Environment/Inverness-County-Water-Quality-Data-Daily-Average-/njv9-c7a6).
      Water Quality Data for other Nova Scotia counties is also available through
      the Open Data Portal. The "Nova Scotia Water Quality Data: Station Locations"
      dataset on the Portal shows locations with available data (https://data.novascotia.ca/Nature-and-Environment/Coastal-Monitoring-Program-Station-Locations/cjfb-f4d4).
      Summary reports by county are available on the CMAR website (https://cmar.ca/2020/07/14/coastal-monitoring-program/).
      Data can also be downloaded from the ERDAPP server through the Canadian Integrated
      Ocean Observing System (CIOOS) platform (https://catalogue.cioosatlantic.ca/dataset?q=cmar).
      Data collection and retrieval are ongoing. Some data are excluded from the final
      dataset during quality control processes. The datasets and reports may be revised
      pending ongoing data collection and analyses.  A note on units: For Halifax
      and Lunenburg counties, dissolved oxygen was measured in units of percent saturation
      or mg/L, depending on the sensor. For all other counties, dissolved oxygen was
      measured in units of percent saturation. Measurements in mg/L were corrected
      for salinity using the Garcia-Gordon (1992) salinity correction factor with
      a salinity value of 30.6 practical salinity units (based on available data for
      the region). This correction factor is not required for values recorded in percent
      saturation. Please contact info@cmar.ca for more information.  If you have accessed
      any of the Coastal Monitoring Program data, CMAR would appreciate your feedback
      through this quick questionnaire (https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe3TD6umrsVVKnQL13VVMJIpckCi2ctONJsgN7_g-4c-tKTuw/viewform).
