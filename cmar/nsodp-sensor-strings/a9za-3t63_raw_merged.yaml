  abstract:
    en: 'The Centre for Marine Applied Research’s (CMAR) Coastal Monitoring Program
      provides high resolution data on ocean variables from around the coast of Nova
      Scotia. The program was initiated by the Nova Scotia Department of Fisheries
      and Aquaculture in the early 1990s. In 2019, CMAR assumed responsibility for
      the program and expanded its scope and mandate. Through the Water Quality Branch
      of the program, CMAR collects temperature, dissolved oxygen, and salinity data
      using sensors deployed on “sensor strings”. A sensor string typically consists
      of a line anchored to the sea floor by an acoustic release and suspended by
      a sub-surface buoy, with sensors attached at various depths below the surface
      (as measured at low tide). Alternatively, a string may be attached to surface
      moorings, including floating docks, buoys, and equipment. Sensor strings are
      deployed for several months, and data are measured every 1 minute to 1 hour.
      Sensors are retrieved for data offload by triggering the acoustic release when
      applicable, by directly removing from surface moorings, or occasionally by divers
      or grappling methods. Automated Quality Control tests have been applied to the
      data to identify outlying and unexpected observations. The results of these
      tests are summarized in the “qc_flag” columns of the dataset. Each data point
      is assigned a flag value of “Pass”, “Suspect/Of Interest”, “Fail”, or “Not Evaluated”.
      Observations flagged as “Pass” passed all tests and can be included in analyses.
      Dissolved oxygen observations flagged as “Suspect/Of Interest” likely indicate
      biofouling signals and should be excluded from analysis or used with extreme
      caution. Observations for other variables flagged as “Suspect/Of Interest” should
      be reviewed before being included in analyses. Observations flagged as “Fail”
      should be excluded from most analyses. Some tests cannot be applied to certain
      observations, which will be flagged as “Not Evaluated”. These observations can
      typically be included in analyses. Flags should be used as a guide only, and
      data users are responsible for evaluating the quality of the data prior to use
      in any analysis. For more information about the Quality Control tests, visit
      the CMAR Data Governance website (https://dempsey-cmar.github.io/cmp-data-governance/pages/cmp_about.html).
      The Coastal Monitoring Program Water Quality data is organized by county. These
      datasets are very large, typically exceeding the number of rows that can be
      viewed in Excel. CMAR recommends filtering the data to the waterbody, station,
      depth, quality control flag, and/or time period of interest before exporting.
      A chart derived from the dataset also allows for interactive filtering and export
      (https://data.novascotia.ca/d/njv9-c7a6). The "Nova Scotia Water Quality Data:
      Station Locations" dataset on this Portal shows additional locations with available
      Water Quality data collected through CMAR’s Coastal Monitoring Program (https://data.novascotia.ca/Nature-and-Environment/Coastal-Monitoring-Program-Station-Locations/cjfb-f4d4).
      Summary reports by county are available on the CMAR website (https://cmar.ca/coastal-monitoring-program/).
      Data can also be downloaded from the ERDAPP server through the Canadian Integrated
      Ocean Observing System (CIOOS) platform (https://catalogue.cioosatlantic.ca/dataset?q=cmar).
      Data collection and retrieval are ongoing. The datasets and reports may be revised
      pending ongoing data collection and analyses. If you have accessed any Coastal
      Monitoring Program data, CMAR would appreciate your feedback: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe3TD6umrsVVKnQL13VVMJIpckCi2ctONJsgN7_g-4c-tKTuw/viewform.
