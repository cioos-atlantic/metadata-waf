  abstract:
    en: 'The Centre for Marine Applied Research (CMAR) measures environmental data
      throughout Nova Scotia’s coastal waters as part of the Coastal Monitoring Program.
      This program was initiated by the Nova Scotia Department of Fisheries and Aquaculture
      in 2012 and CMAR became involved in 2017. CMAR collects temperature (degrees
      Celsius), dissolved oxygen (% saturation), and intermittent salinity (practical
      salinity units) data using autonomous sensors attached to moored lines, called
      ‘sensor strings’. Each string is attached to the seafloor by an anchored acoustic
      release and suspended by a sub-surface buoy, with sensors attached at various
      depths. Sensor strings are typically deployed for several months, and data are
      measured every 1 minute to 1 hour depending on the sensor. Data are retrieved
      by triggering the acoustic release, enabling the sensor string to float to the
      surface for data download. Some data are excluded from the final dataset during
      quality control processes.   The Coastal Monitoring Program data is organized
      by county. These datasets are very large, typically exceeding the number of
      rows that can be viewed in Excel. We recommend using the filter options of the
      Open Data Portal to filter to the WATERBODY, STATION, DEPTH, VARIABLE, and/or
      TIMESTAMP of interest before exporting. A chart derived from the dataset also
      allows for interactive filtering and export (https://data.novascotia.ca/Nature-and-Environment/Coastal-Monitoring-Program-Annapolis-County-Daily-/a3qb-nf5k).   Coastal
      Monitoring Program data for other Nova Scotia counties is also available through
      the Open Data Portal. The "Coastal Monitoring Program: Station Locations" dataset
      on the Portal shows locations with available data (https://data.novascotia.ca/Nature-and-Environment/Coastal-Monitoring-Program-Station-Locations/cjfb-f4d4).
      Summary reports by county are available on the CMAR website (https://cmar.ca/2020/07/14/coastal-monitoring-program/).
      Data collection and retrieval are ongoing. The datasets and reports may be revised
      pending ongoing data collection and analyses.Contains information licensed under

      Monitoring Program data, CMAR would appreciate your feedback through this quick
